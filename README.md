# PID_Hector_Quadrotor
The Aim of the project is to control hector quadrotor to go through the waypoints by using PID(Proportional Integral and Differential) controllers using python code in mid-fidelity physics simulation software, GAZEBO. Communication between these is achieved through ROS (Robot Operating System).
